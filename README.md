## What This Is

In long-lived projects, the most common AI failure modes are not "the answer was not smart enough once," but:

- gradually forgetting context
- drifting away from the current sprint or phase
- breaking architectural boundaries
- finishing tasks without leaving reviewable knowledge behind

This repository provides governance documents, validation tools, and runtime hooks that move an AI coding workflow from:

`AI -> code -> human review`

to:

`AI -> runtime governance -> task execution -> session lifecycle -> memory governance`

The most precise current positioning is:

- a runnable `AI Coding Runtime Governance Framework prototype`
- a framework with a real runtime governance spine, not just static policy documents
- an established external domain validator seam, with the first firmware vertical slice already running
- still actively strengthening semantic verification, workflow embedding, and interception coverage

## Alpha Status

Current release-facing status:

- version: `v1.0.0-alpha`
- release notes: [docs/releases/v1.0.0-alpha.md](docs/releases/v1.0.0-alpha.md)
- release index: [docs/releases/README.md](docs/releases/README.md)
- changelog: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- known limits: [docs/LIMITATIONS.md](docs/LIMITATIONS.md)
- status index: [docs/status/README.md](docs/status/README.md)
- trust signal dashboard: [docs/status/trust-signal-dashboard.md](docs/status/trust-signal-dashboard.md)
- domain enforcement matrix: [docs/status/domain-enforcement-matrix.md](docs/status/domain-enforcement-matrix.md)

This alpha is suitable for evaluation, internal adoption trials, and domain-contract experimentation.
It should still be treated as a governance framework prototype rather than a fully closed enforcement platform.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Governance Constitution

The `governance/` directory defines AI roles, boundaries, and stop conditions inside the repository:

- `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`
- `HUMAN-OVERSIGHT.md`
- `AGENT.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `REVIEW_CRITERIA.md`
- `TESTING.md`
- `NATIVE-INTEROP.md`
- `PLAN.md`

The `.github/` directory also provides a pre-runtime interaction layer:

- `copilot-instructions.md` as a repo-wide baseline
- `.github/agents/*.agent.md` as role definitions
- `.github/skills/*/skill.md` as behavior-level skill policies

### 2. Static Governance Tooling

`governance_tools/` currently includes:

- `contract_validator.py`
- `plan_freshness.py`
- `memory_janitor.py`
- `state_generator.py`
- `rule_pack_loader.py`
- `test_result_ingestor.py`
- `failure_test_validator.py`
- `failure_completeness_validator.py`
- `public_api_diff_checker.py`
- `driver_evidence_validator.py`
- `rule_pack_suggester.py`
- `architecture_drift_checker.py`
- `governance_auditor.py`
- `change_proposal_builder.py`
- `change_control_summary.py`

### 3. Runtime Governance

`runtime_hooks/` currently supports:

- a shared event contract
- a dispatcher
- `session_start`
- `pre_task_check`
- `post_task_check`
- `session_end`
- Claude Code / Codex / Gemini adapters
- `session_start -> pre_task_check -> post_task_check -> session_end -> memory pipeline`

This runtime governance loop is real and operational, but interception coverage is still not fully closed. Some IDE, local-edit, or direct-commit paths can still bypass it.

### 4. Memory Pipeline

`memory_pipeline/` currently supports:

- `session_snapshot.py`
- `memory_curator.py`
- `promotion_policy.py`
- `memory_promoter.py`
- `session_end.py` / `memory_curator.py` now also preserve domain contract metadata
  - for example: `contract_source`, `contract_name`, `contract_domain`, `plugin_version`
  - so external domain governance context can survive into summaries and curated artifacts

### 5. Rule Packs

Built-in rule packs currently include:

Scope packs:

- `common`
- `refactor`

Language packs:

- `python`
- `cpp`
- `csharp`
- `swift`

Framework packs:

- `avalonia`

Platform packs:

- `kernel-driver`

Highlights:

- `cpp` includes build-boundary rules such as forbidding cross-project private includes and incorrect `AdditionalIncludeDirectories` usage
- `csharp` focuses on thread and native boundaries
- `avalonia` focuses on UI thread and ViewModel boundaries
- `swift` focuses on concurrency and native interop boundaries
- `kernel-driver` focuses on IRQL, memory boundaries, cleanup, unwind, and other privileged-risk concerns
- `kernel-driver` evidence should come primarily from SDV / SAL / WDK analysis outputs and driver-focused tests, not from a homemade "do everything" parser
- rule packs currently behave more like a policy activation layer than a full policy engine
- `test_result_ingestor.py` now normalizes not only `pytest-text` / `junit-xml`, but also `sdv-text`, `msbuild-warning-text`, `sarif`, and `wdk-analysis-text`
- `architecture_drift_checker.py` now supports before/after dependency edge diffs in addition to high-signal heuristics
- `state_generator.py` now emits advisory `rule_pack_suggestions`, but does not silently rewrite `runtime_contract.rules`
- `pre_task_check.py` now surfaces the same advisory suggestions so runtime entrypoints and state views stay aligned
- when a high-confidence language/framework suggestion is not loaded, `pre_task_check.py` emits an advisory warning instead of auto-rewriting the contract
- `rule_pack_suggester.py`, `state_generator.py`, and `pre_task_check.py` now all expose `suggested_rules_preview` for quick adoption
- those same tools also expose advisory `suggested_skills` and `suggested_agent`
- `pre_task_check --format human` now prints `suggested_rules_preview=...`
  - and also prints `suggested_skills=...` and `suggested_agent=...`
- `pre_task_check.py` / `state_generator.py` can now include `architecture_impact_preview`
  - when proposal risk exceeds the current contract, the result remains advisory and does not auto-rewrite `RULES`, `RISK`, or `OVERSIGHT`
  - both tools now also include proposal guidance such as `expected_validators` and `required_evidence`
- `pre_task_check --format human` now prints `impact_validators=...` and `impact_evidence=...`
- `session_end.py` / `memory_curator.py` now preserve `architecture_impact_preview`
  - proposal-time concerns and expected evidence are carried into summary and curated artifacts as part of the audit trail
- `session_end.py` / `memory_curator.py` now preserve `proposal_summary`
  - proposal-time risk / oversight guidance, concerns, and required evidence are carried into summary and curated artifacts
- `post_task_check --format human` now prints evidence summaries such as `public_api_ok=...` and `failure_completeness_ok=...`
- `architecture_impact_estimator.py` can now produce a structured `Governance Impact Report` during the proposal phase
  - path-based layer heuristics (`touched_layers`, `boundary_risk`)
  - evidence forecasting (`expected_validators`, `required_evidence`)
  - impact signals (`concerns`, `recommended_risk`, `recommended_oversight`)
  - it remains an advisory estimator, not a replacement for governance judgment

### 6. External Domain Seam

The framework currently supports an external domain extension seam with:

- `contract.yaml` discovery
- external rule roots
- validator preflight
- validator execution
- contract-level hard-stop escalation for selected validator rule IDs

The built-in example is `examples/usb-hub-contract/`, which can currently:

- load firmware domain documents and behavior overrides
- activate an external `hub-firmware` rule pack
- run `interrupt_safety_validator.py`
- infer interrupt context from `diff_text`, unified diffs, changed source files, and file-based `checks-file` / `diff_file` evidence

This seam has already been validated with three external contract repos:

- `USB-Hub-Firmware-Architecture-Contract`
  - the first real firmware vertical slice
  - already running through `session_start`, `pre_task_check`, and `post_task_check`
  - now also demonstrates contract-driven hard-stop enforcement for `HUB-004` interrupt-safety violations
- `Kernel-Driver-Contract`
  - the second low-level domain slice
  - already running through contract loading, validator preflight, external rule activation, and a multi-validator post-task loop with contract-driven hard-stop escalation
- `IC-Verification-Contract`
  - the third domain slice, focused on Cocotb-style signal-map verification
  - already running through contract loading, validator preflight, external rule activation, and a mixed hard-stop/advisory post-task loop driven by machine-readable DUT facts

To reduce adoption friction, runtime hooks now support contract auto-discovery:

- use explicit `--contract` first
- otherwise read `AI_GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT`
- otherwise search upward from `project_root` or evidence file paths for `contract.yaml`
- discovery ascends at most 3 levels and stops at a `.git` boundary
- when multiple candidates are found, it does not silently pick one; it returns a warning and asks for an explicit path

For multi-domain reviewer flows, the framework also preserves minimal contract governance metadata:

- `contract_source`
- `contract_name`
- `contract_domain`
- `plugin_version`
- `contract_risk_tier`

Current built-in risk-tier defaults:

- `kernel-driver` -> `high`
- `firmware` -> `medium`

## Local Execution Requirements

The governance tools and runtime hooks in this repo require Python 3.9+.

If `python`, `python3`, or `py -3` is not on `PATH`, set:

```bash
export AI_GOVERNANCE_PYTHON=/path/to/python
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:AI_GOVERNANCE_PYTHON='C:\Path\To\python.exe'
```

`scripts/run-runtime-governance.sh`, `scripts/verify_phase_gates.sh`, and installed git hooks all prefer this variable.

When hooks are installed into another repo, the install script now writes a framework-root pointer under the target repo's `.git/hooks/` directory so the copied hooks can call back into `ai-governance-framework` instead of assuming all governance scripts live inside the target repo.
After installation, you can also run `governance_tools/hook_install_validator.py --repo /path/to/repo` to verify copied hooks and framework-root wiring.
By default, `scripts/install-hooks.sh` now runs this validator automatically after installation; if you only want installation without verification, use `--no-verify`.
If you want a single readiness check for an external repo's hook / PLAN / contract state, run `governance_tools/external_repo_readiness.py --repo /path/to/repo`.
If you want a single onboarding entrypoint, run `scripts/onboard-external-repo.sh --target /path/to/repo`, which combines hook installation with a readiness report.
That onboarding flow now also includes a minimal governance smoke test by default, so onboarding checks that `session_start` and `pre_task_check` can actually run against the external contract instead of only verifying static setup.
By default it also writes a JSON onboarding report to `memory/governance_onboarding/latest.json` inside the target repo, so onboarding state remains reviewable after the terminal session ends.
That onboarding report now also maintains `history/*.json`, `history/*.txt`, `latest.txt`, and `INDEX.txt`, so external repo setup state becomes a small auditable artifact set instead of a single overwritten file.
If you are tracking multiple external repos, you can aggregate their latest onboarding states with `governance_tools/external_repo_onboarding_index.py --repo /path/to/repo1 --repo /path/to/repo2`.

Example:

```text
RULES = common,csharp,avalonia,refactor
```

- `common`: global governance baseline
- `csharp`: language-level boundary, threading, and native contract rules
- `avalonia`: UI / Dispatcher / ViewModel boundaries
- `refactor`: change-type governance requiring behavior lock and boundary safety, then gradually asking for interface stability, regression evidence, and cleanup / rollback evidence

A high-risk platform example:

```text
RULES = common,cpp,kernel-driver,refactor
RISK = high
OVERSIGHT = human-approval
MEMORY_MODE = candidate
```

## Runtime Governance Overview

Core Governance Contract fields:

```text
RULES       = <comma-separated rule packs>
RISK        = <low|medium|high>
OVERSIGHT   = <auto|review-required|human-approval>
MEMORY_MODE = <stateless|candidate|durable>
```

## Quick Start

For a five-minute guided run, start with [start_session.md](start_session.md).

If you want a single command that checks the documented quickstart path end to end:

```bash
python governance_tools/quickstart_smoke.py --project-root . --plan PLAN.md --contract examples/usb-hub-contract/contract.yaml --format human
```

If you want a higher-level release/adoption overview in one command:

```bash
python governance_tools/trust_signal_overview.py --project-root . --plan PLAN.md --release-version v1.0.0-alpha --contract examples/usb-hub-contract/contract.yaml --external-contract-repo D:/USB-Hub-Firmware-Architecture-Contract --external-contract-repo D:/Kernel-Driver-Contract --external-contract-repo D:/IC-Verification-Contract --format human
```

If you want the same view persisted as a latest/history/index bundle:

```bash
python governance_tools/trust_signal_snapshot.py --project-root . --plan PLAN.md --release-version v1.0.0-alpha --contract examples/usb-hub-contract/contract.yaml --external-contract-repo D:/USB-Hub-Firmware-Architecture-Contract --external-contract-repo D:/Kernel-Driver-Contract --external-contract-repo D:/IC-Verification-Contract --write-bundle artifacts/trust-signals --publish-status-dir artifacts/trust-signals/published --format human
```

If you want the same publication written to a stable repo-local docs path:

```bash
python governance_tools/trust_signal_snapshot.py --project-root . --plan PLAN.md --release-version v1.0.0-alpha --contract examples/usb-hub-contract/contract.yaml --external-contract-repo D:/USB-Hub-Firmware-Architecture-Contract --external-contract-repo D:/Kernel-Driver-Contract --external-contract-repo D:/IC-Verification-Contract --publish-docs-status --format human
```

If you want a stable reader over the generated publication metadata:

```bash
python governance_tools/trust_signal_publication_reader.py --file artifacts/trust-signals/PUBLICATION_MANIFEST.json --format human
```

If you are publishing to the repo-local docs path, you can read that stable location directly:

```bash
python governance_tools/trust_signal_publication_reader.py --project-root . --docs-status --format human
```

If you want a release-facing package summary that bundles the current alpha docs, status surfaces, and verification commands into one reviewer handoff:

```bash
python governance_tools/release_package_summary.py --version v1.0.0-alpha --format human
```

If you want the same release package preserved as a latest/history/index bundle:

```bash
python governance_tools/release_package_snapshot.py --version v1.0.0-alpha --write-bundle artifacts/release-package/v1.0.0-alpha --format human
```

If you want a stable reader over that release-package bundle:

```bash
python governance_tools/release_package_reader.py --version v1.0.0-alpha --file artifacts/release-package/v1.0.0-alpha/MANIFEST.json --format human
```

If you want a stable reader over the generated release root itself:

```bash
python governance_tools/release_package_publication_reader.py --project-root . --docs-release-root --format human
```

If you want one reviewer-first command that rolls release readiness, package docs, and any available generated release surfaces into a single overview:

```bash
python governance_tools/release_surface_overview.py --version v1.0.0-alpha --format human
```

If you publish repo-local generated release packages, the stable landing path becomes:

- `docs/releases/generated/README.md`

That same docs-status path also emits `docs/status/generated/README.md`, so the generated root has a stable landing page instead of only raw manifests.

CI now also generates trust-signal snapshot bundles, so this high-level view is not limited to local terminal output.
Each bundle now also includes manifest metadata, published history/index pages, and a publication-level manifest/index, so tools or readers can tell which snapshot is current without inferring from filenames alone. When external contract repos are provided, those manifests also carry a compact cross-domain enforcement summary instead of only a yes/no policy flag.
The published status surface now also emits a dedicated domain-enforcement matrix page, so cross-domain hard-stop posture can be shared without opening the full trust-signal dashboard.
CI now also generates release-package bundles under `artifacts/release-package/`, so alpha-facing docs, status surfaces, and verification commands can be reviewed as a preserved artifact instead of only local CLI output.

### Minimum Viable Setup

Install the documented local dependencies first:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The core framework stays largely stdlib-first, but `requirements.txt` covers:

- local validation via `pytest`
- the runnable FastAPI demo under `examples/todo-app-demo`

If you want to bring this governance framework into an existing project, the simplest path is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GavinWu672/ai-governance-framework.git
cd ai-governance-framework

./deploy_to_memory.sh /path/to/your/project
```

Or copy the essentials manually:

```bash
cp -r governance /path/to/your/project/
cp -r governance_tools /path/to/your/project/
```

At minimum, prepare:

- `governance/`
- `PLAN.md`
- `memory/`

Then, when starting a new conversation or a new agent session, ask the agent to do this first:

```text
Please read governance/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md in full,
follow the initialization process in section 2,
and report back with a [Governance Contract] block.
```

### Example Projects

- `examples/README.md`

- `examples/todo-app-demo/`
- `examples/chaos-demo/`

Change-control summary flow:

```text

        ↓
change_control_summary.py
        ↓

```

`change_control_summary.py --format human` now starts with a reviewer-first summary line, then drills into proposal and runtime sections.
`change_control_index.py` also enriches artifacts with contract context from the corresponding `*_session_start.json`, so reviewers can see which domain contract drove each session when scanning across sessions.
`session_end.py` human output, summary artifacts, and curated artifacts preserve the same contract metadata, so the reviewer chain stays consistent in multi-domain environments.

### Adapters

```bash
python runtime_hooks/adapters/claude_code/normalize_event.py --event-type pre_task --file claude_event.json
python runtime_hooks/adapters/codex/normalize_event.py --event-type post_task --file codex_event.json
python runtime_hooks/adapters/gemini/normalize_event.py --event-type pre_task --file gemini_event.json
```

### Memory Pipeline

```bash
python memory_pipeline/session_snapshot.py --memory-root memory --task "Runtime governance" --summary "Captured a candidate snapshot"
python memory_pipeline/memory_curator.py --candidate-file artifacts/runtime/candidates/<session_id>.json --output artifacts/runtime/curated/<session_id>.json
python memory_pipeline/memory_promoter.py --memory-root memory --candidate-file memory/candidates/session_*.json --approved-by reviewer-01
```

### Smoke Test

```bash
python runtime_hooks/smoke_test.py --harness claude_code --event-type pre_task
python runtime_hooks/smoke_test.py --harness claude_code --event-type session_start
python runtime_hooks/smoke_test.py --harness codex --event-type post_task
python runtime_hooks/smoke_test.py --harness codex --event-type session_start
python runtime_hooks/smoke_test.py --harness gemini --event-type post_task
python runtime_hooks/smoke_test.py --harness gemini --event-type session_start
python runtime_hooks/smoke_test.py --event-type session_start
```

`session_start` smoke output now shows startup handoff summaries directly, including the active contract, expected validators, and required evidence.
Shared enforcement now also preserves:

- `*_session_start.txt` handoff notes
- `*_session_start.json` machine-readable startup envelopes
- `*_change_control_summary.txt` proposal-to-startup review summaries
- `INDEX.txt` change-control artifact index

Among these, `*_session_start.json` can be used directly as input to `change_control_summary.py --session-start-file ...`.

### Shared Enforcement

```bash
bash scripts/run-runtime-governance.sh --mode enforce
```

## Multi-Tool Support

The runtime layer currently supports multiple AI tools:

- Claude Code
- Codex
- Gemini

These tools all normalize native payloads into the same shared event contract before entering governance checks.

`session_start` currently exists first as a shared governance event for agent startup and handoff context; native harness adapters can be added on top later.
The shared adapter runner can now already process `session_start`, so startup chains can be exercised through shared/native examples today.

## CI and Validation

The GitHub Actions workflow lives at:

- `.github/workflows/governance.yml`

It now includes the shared runtime enforcement path and verifies:

- native payload normalization
- shared event dispatch
- pre/post-task checks
- session close and curated memory flow
- the focused runtime governance test suite
- uploaded `artifacts/runtime/smoke/` handoff summaries from `session_start` smoke flows
- uploaded JSON startup envelopes and derived change-control summaries from `session_start` smoke flows

## Current Boundary

This repo is positioned as a **runtime governance framework prototype**, not a general-purpose agent platform.

It is focused on:

- governance constitution
- runtime governance lifecycle
- session lifecycle closeout
- memory governance
- reviewable project truth

It is not currently trying to become:

- a plugin marketplace
- a large command registry
- a general-purpose subagent orchestration platform
