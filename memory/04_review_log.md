# Review Log

## 2026-03-13 - Governance Progress Snapshot

- Reviewed current repository position after startup, proposal, and change-control features were added.
- Confirmed the repo has moved beyond document-only governance into evidence-aware runtime governance with proposal-time guidance.
- Recorded the key remaining gaps as:
  - semantic verification depth
  - workflow interception coverage
  - reviewer consumption of change-control outputs

## 2026-03-13 - Smoke Regression Fix

- Fixed a CI/runtime smoke regression where `runtime_hooks/smoke_test.py` assumed every human-rendered envelope exposed top-level `event_type`.
- Shared session-start envelopes expose top-level `event_type`, but adapter-driven envelopes rely on `normalized_event.event_type`.
- The formatter now supports both shapes, and regression coverage was added in `tests/test_runtime_smoke_test.py`.

## 2026-03-14 - Local Baseline Validation Blocked

- Started the first prerequisite task for the USB-Hub integration plan: local execution baseline validation.
- Confirmed that this workstation currently has no `python`, `py`, `python3`, or `uv` command available in `PATH`.
- As a result, `pre_task_check.py`, `session_start.py`, and `pytest` could not be executed locally, so runtime maturity remains unverified on this machine.
- Immediate next action is to restore or expose a Python runtime before continuing Phase 1 validation.

## 2026-03-14 - Python Entrypoint Hardening

- Added shared interpreter resolution in `scripts/lib/python.sh`.
- Updated `scripts/run-runtime-governance.sh` and `scripts/verify_phase_gates.sh` to honor `AI_GOVERNANCE_PYTHON` before falling back to `python`, `python3`, or `py -3`.
- Updated installed git hooks to resolve the repository root before sourcing shared shell helpers, avoiding broken relative paths under `.git/hooks`.
- Documented the new override path in `README.md` and `governance_tools/README.md`.

## 2026-03-14 - Local Baseline Restored

- Located the workstation's usable interpreter at `C:\Users\daish\AppData\Local\Python\pythoncore-3.14-64\python.exe` by tracing `D:\Bookstore-Scraper\.venv\pyvenv.cfg`.
- Confirmed the interpreter is Python `3.14.2`.
- Verified `governance_tools/plan_freshness.py --format json` returns `FRESH`.
- Verified `runtime_hooks/core/pre_task_check.py --rules common,python --risk medium --oversight review-required --format human` runs successfully and emits advisory suggestions.
- Ran `scripts/verify_phase_gates.sh` with `AI_GOVERNANCE_PYTHON` set to the discovered interpreter; result: `259 passed`, `4/4 Gates` passed.
- Ran `scripts/run-runtime-governance.sh --mode smoke` with the same interpreter override; shared and adapter smoke flows completed successfully and produced change-control artifacts under `artifacts/runtime/smoke/`.

## 2026-03-14 - contract.yaml Discovery Seam Added

- Added `governance_tools/domain_contract_loader.py` as a stdlib-only loader for minimal external `contract.yaml` files.
- Extended `rule_pack_loader.py` so built-in and external rule roots can be merged during runtime governance.
- Added `--contract` support to `runtime_hooks/core/pre_task_check.py`, `session_start.py`, and `post_task_check.py`.
- `session_start` now carries discovered domain documents, rule roots, and validator metadata into startup context.
- `post_task_check` now validates external rule packs against discovered contract rule roots, instead of rejecting them as unknown.
- Added targeted tests for domain contract loading, external rule-root loading, session-start contract integration, and post-task contract validation.
- Verification:
  - `tests/test_domain_contract_loader.py tests/test_rule_pack_loader.py tests/test_runtime_session_start.py tests/test_runtime_post_task_check.py` -> `29 passed`
  - `tests/test_contract_validator.py tests/test_rule_pack_loader.py tests/test_runtime_pre_task_check.py tests/test_runtime_session_start.py tests/test_runtime_post_task_check.py tests/test_runtime_smoke_test.py` -> `87 passed`

## 2026-03-14 - USB-Hub Example Contract Validation

- Added `examples/usb-hub-contract/` as a minimal dual-repo style domain plugin sample.
- Added a runnable `governance_tools/domain_contract_loader.py --contract ...` CLI so contract discovery can be validated outside unit tests.
- Extended session-start human output to surface domain document names, behavior-override names, and first-line previews.
- Example contract now includes:
  - `contract.yaml`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `USB_HUB_FW_CHECKLIST.md`
  - `USB_HUB_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `rules/hub-firmware/safety.md`
  - `validators/interrupt_safety_validator.py`
- Validation completed:
  - `domain_contract_loader.py --contract examples/usb-hub-contract/contract.yaml --format human`
  - `session_start.py --contract examples/usb-hub-contract/contract.yaml --format human`
  - `pre_task_check.py --contract examples/usb-hub-contract/contract.yaml --format json`
- Added example-focused tests:
  - `tests/test_domain_contract_example.py`
  - targeted verification result: `17 passed`

## 2026-03-14 - Advisory Domain Validator Execution

- Added `governance_tools/validator_interface.py` with shared `DomainValidator` and `ValidatorResult` types.
- Added `governance_tools/domain_validator_loader.py` for isolated validator discovery, startup preflight, payload building, and advisory execution.
- `session_start.py` now reports validator preflight status so broken domain validators are visible before task execution begins.
- `post_task_check.py` now routes matching external validators and merges their findings as advisory warnings.
- Upgraded `examples/usb-hub-contract/validators/interrupt_safety_validator.py` from placeholder metadata to a real advisory validator that scans ISR code for forbidden calls.
- Verification:
  - `tests/test_domain_validator_loader.py tests/test_domain_contract_example.py tests/test_runtime_session_start.py tests/test_runtime_post_task_check.py` -> `23 passed`
  - `tests/test_contract_validator.py tests/test_domain_contract_loader.py tests/test_domain_validator_loader.py tests/test_domain_contract_example.py tests/test_rule_pack_loader.py tests/test_runtime_pre_task_check.py tests/test_runtime_session_start.py tests/test_runtime_post_task_check.py tests/test_runtime_smoke_test.py` -> `94 passed`
