# Trust Signal Dashboard

Updated: 2026-03-15

This page is the stable in-repo entry point for the framework's current adoption
and release-facing trust signals.

Use it when you want one place to understand:

- whether the documented quickstart still works
- whether bundled examples are still healthy
- whether release-facing docs are aligned
- whether the governance self-audit still passes

## Fastest Local Command

```bash
python governance_tools/trust_signal_overview.py \
  --project-root . \
  --plan PLAN.md \
  --release-version v1.0.0-alpha \
  --contract examples/usb-hub-contract/contract.yaml \
  --format human
```

If you want a shareable dashboard-style output:

```bash
python governance_tools/trust_signal_overview.py \
  --project-root . \
  --plan PLAN.md \
  --release-version v1.0.0-alpha \
  --contract examples/usb-hub-contract/contract.yaml \
  --format markdown
```

## CI Artifacts

CI now emits trust-signal overview artifacts under:

- `artifacts/trust-signals/trust_signal_overview.txt`
- `artifacts/trust-signals/trust_signal_overview.json`
- `artifacts/trust-signals/trust_signal_overview.md`

These artifacts are the generated status snapshot.

This page is the stable landing page that explains where those generated reports
come from and how to regenerate them locally.

## What “Healthy” Currently Means

For the current alpha, the expected high-level posture is:

- quickstart smoke passes
- example readiness passes
- release readiness passes
- governance auditor passes

This does **not** mean:

- full interception coverage is closed
- domain validators are universally hard-stop
- semantic verification is equivalent to a full policy engine

Those boundaries remain part of the current alpha honesty model and should stay
visible in release-facing communication.
